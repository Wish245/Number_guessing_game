# Number_guessing_game
Python approach
in this version uses the random library withradInt function to take a random integer.
then using if and else statements user goes through a process of guessing the number
after some attempts the game stops after user guess the correct answer and system shows the number of attempts.

C# approach

This is going to be the firstever non Unity related C# code I ever written. Im going to implement the same by using C#.
